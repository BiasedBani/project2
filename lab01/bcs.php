					Tied up in my interest in film was always an interest in psychology. Between what the many communicated intentionally, what the audiences understood, and where the signal breaks and fills with static along the way (in many interesting cases, to the betterment of the film overall!) there is a whole lot to look at. I started with BCS as my intended major, but ultimately decided that I wanted to specialize in film. Still, psychology is an incredible field, and one with a huge number of unknowns and areas of active research. I was curious about both psychology and neuroscience (fields which have overhauled several major areas of reasearch, even just in the four years of me being at the U of R!)- BCS seemed like the ideal crossover.
