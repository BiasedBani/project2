					History was a minor I fell into sideways. I have always liked to learn and apply history, especially in political science. Over four years, I spontaneously decided to take several courses on music, conflicts, periods of upheavel, and pieces of history that are missing, difficult to access, or which have been stripped away entirely. One of my favorite classes involved transcribing letters from a family in the 1800s, an experience that I found both surreal and surprisingly moving. In the end, I had a minor.
