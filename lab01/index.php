					After a few brief explorations of Golden Age film history (courtesy of essays in my high school English department), I discovered that the  limitations and unique communication style of film make it pretty hard to get a read on. When there are endless moving parts: the intention; the production; the hundreds of people running interference; the decisions of every single cast and crew member; and the layers on layers of metadecisions make unraveling a movie nigh impossible. Also: really fun to try and puzzle together, picking apart a whole hour and half piece, looking for any set of patterns I could possibly dig out. After another class, I learned to appreciate analysis and production- I decided to take a film class when I went to the UofR, and over two years, I had done a fairly even amount of constructing and deconstructing video. I decided to major in the production track.
