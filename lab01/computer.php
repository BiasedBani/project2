					I knew little about computer science coming out of high school and decided to try and improve the situation with an intro programming class. I really enjoyed the class. Especially interesting to me was the way it changed the way I thought. I like to program in part as a way of creating and in part because of the more linear attributes- because of the way it interlocks. Unlike most of the other areas I study, programs have an exact way of fitting together, piece by piece- no matter how complex it is. That way of thinking helped me in every other subject I studied: it was completely opposite to the way I normally approach questions. After another year, I decided to persue a minor and gained experience with versatile programs I may not have ever used otherwise. I have absolutely no doubt I will use this experience throughout my life.
