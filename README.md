# City-team: DC
- Team members: Huiyu Yang, Joe Madejski, Qi Miao
## Classes and relationships
[not the actual triples]

## Decisions about the choreography
[why is the layout as it is?]
- In courses taken, course name is also included with course number to be more informative

## Readability changes to original project 1 css:
- Changed color of < aside > from silver to white for better contrast with background since < aside > now holds more content
- Removed the 3Â° tilt on < aside > because it now holds more content
- Added dashed line and increased padding to create vertical devide between sections
